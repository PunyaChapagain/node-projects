What is Node?
As an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, 
Node is designed to build scalable network applications.
 In the following mamata "hello world" example, many connections 
 can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection the callback is fired, 
 but if there is no work to be done, node will sleep.
